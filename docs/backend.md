# Backend Components

The backend of the compiler is responsible for generating executable code from the validated Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The main component is the code generator, which handles the conversion of the AST into target code.

## Code Generation (`codegen.ml`)

The code generator is the core of the backend and handles:
- Converting AST nodes into target code
- Managing registers and memory
- Handling control flow
- Implementing optimizations

### Key Features

1. **Target Code Generation**
   - Converts high-level language constructs into target instructions
   - Handles different types of expressions and statements
   - Manages function calls and returns
   - Implements control structures (if, while, etc.)

2. **Register Allocation**
   - Efficient use of available registers
   - Spill handling when registers are exhausted
   - Register reuse optimization

3. **Memory Management**
   - Stack frame management
   - Variable storage and access
   - Heap allocation when needed

4. **Optimizations**
   - Constant folding
   - Dead code elimination
   - Common subexpression elimination
   - Loop optimizations

### Error Handling

The backend implements error handling for:
- Register allocation failures
- Memory access violations
- Code generation errors
- Optimization failures

## Integration with Frontend

The backend receives:
- Validated AST from the semantic analyzer
- Type information
- Symbol table data
- Other semantic information

It produces:
- Target-specific executable code
- Debug information
- Optimization reports

## Target Support

The backend is designed to support multiple target architectures:
- x86
- ARM
- Other architectures (as needed)

Each target requires specific implementations for:
- Instruction selection
- Register allocation
- Calling conventions
- Memory access patterns
